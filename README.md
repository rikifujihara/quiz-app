## Displaying the quiz to the user


The most major feature of this application is displaying a selection of mupltiple choice quizzes to the user. The user can choose from different quizzes by either selecting from within the app itself or passing in command line arguments together with the executable scripts. There are also scripts that can be executed by themselves to directly choose a quiz without any additional arguments.
